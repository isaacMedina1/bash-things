# Bang Bang scripts

Files that where very useful on information parsing and planning of the Pd gathering called "Bang Bang"

Mainly:
  - Previewing CSV on Terminal
  - Sorting CSV
  - Getting data from CSV as common text
  - Parsing CSV with JavaScript and writting to DOM
  - Some diagrams for audio setup

No CSVs here, just code. Create your own to play with this files ;)
